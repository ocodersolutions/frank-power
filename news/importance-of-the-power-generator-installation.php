Today, people uses more amount of electricity because of the increased usage of electronic devices like television, air-conditioner etc. This leads to insufficient of electricity so that people began to use the generator in order to save the electricity for the future needs. In case, there is no power supply in your home or any other commercial purpose, then you can use the stored power of the generator. The generator is a backup power supply to use in the event of an emergency power outage or the generator used occasionally for convenience. There are many numbers of different models and styles of generators available in order to satisfy the power needs. Among that generator, the power generator is more famous and commonly used by all kinds of the people because the operational cost is low and it is easy to operate/use. The power generator installation is a device that transforms any form of motion into usable electricity. This generator is normally a type of piston engine or flywheel design. 
There are many types of power generators in use by residential and commercial purpose.  Large manufacturing plants will use a power generator because the big machines require a constant draw of power. Then the electrical companies often implement a massive power generator in order to supplement entire cities with electricity. The power generator installation used in every household and business in some sort throughout the world in terms of eliminating the need for the electricity. The electricity is importance for every purpose, especially in hospitals. Losing the electricity can be problematic sometimes it may last up to one week or more. Hence, the power is vital. To overcome these problems power generators used as an alternative for the power supply. Therefore, this backup system installed as part of the facility electrical wiring. Thus, it will automatically activate once the power failure happens or power shut off. Likewise, the generator will shut off itself once the power supply kept back. 
This kind of generator will be used in the places where frequently loses electricity. This will allow you to keep your vital equipment running. These permanently emergency electricity sources operate on the facilities existing fuel source i.e. either diesel or natural gas. If you want to install the power generator in your home or commercial purpose, then you may call the right professional to do it. They have the proper equipment for the power generator installation and they provide the necessary safety measures as well as guide you how to operate it. Here is the guide for the installation of the power generator.
1.	First, they will unpack the generator and check it if there are any damage occurred during the shipment.
2.	Then they check the rated amperage and wattage capacity in order to know the critical loads during a power outage. 
3.	If more power storage required, then the critical load will group together and wired independently into a distribution panel i.e. provided exclusively with the generator. 
4.	The generator should be placed outdoor with the protective closure where sufficient air for cooling and ventilation available. 
5.	Moreover, the generator should place on a level surface because it is non-combustible and non-conducting.
6.	It recommended placing the generator a little above ground level in order to prevent contact from rising water levels.
7.	The power generator installation should do in close proximity to the location of the transfer switch and the fuel supply in terms of reducing the required length of cabling and piping. 
8.	Grounding is more important for all the equipment because it will prevent you from the shock. You must consult the qualified electrician before doing grounding.
9.	Moreover, all batteries must completely charge before they inserted into the generator.
10.	More care is required for while unpacking the transfer switch as well as installation. The switch should wall-mounted in order to prevent distortion of the switch.
11.	The unit should connect to the electrical system supplied by the utility with the automatic transfer switch.
