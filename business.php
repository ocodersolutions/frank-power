					<p>No one kind of standby generator or power system will meet every need. That's why Generac lets you choose the path that works best for you in getting the standby power you need. Maybe it's a single large diesel-fueled generator—the traditional choice. But it might be that a several gaseous-fueled generators configured in parallel makes more sense for your application.</p>
